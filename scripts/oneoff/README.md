# One-off scripts

Migrations that were run once and are kept for reference. They are not part of the build,
CI or release pipeline and may not work on the current data model; read the code before
running one.

| Script | Purpose | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_manus_roadmap.py` | Topics, directory moves and centroids from the 2026-06-15 roadmap | 1.x |
| `annotate_entity_status.py` | Set `entity_type` and `code_status` on countries | 1.x |
| `invert_attribute_intblocks.py` | Turn attribute-partition intblocks into country fields and write `data/attribute_intblock_migrations.yaml` | 2.0.0 |
| `label_scope_category.py` | Suggest `scope_category` values; does not write YAML | 2.x |

Maintained tools stay in `scripts/` (see the README's script table).
