# When to use Internacia

Use this repository when you need **stable reference data** for:

- **ISO 3166-1 identifiers** (alpha-2 / alpha-3 / numeric) and entity status (`code_status`)
- **Borders** (neighbors stored as ISO alpha-3 codes)
- **International organization / treaty membership rosters** (“intblocks”), including reliable **join keys**
- **Entity linking** (multilingual names/aliases + Wikidata IDs)

Do **not** use Internacia for socioeconomic or time-series analytics:

- HDI, GDP, government type, internet penetration
- governance scores, macro time-series indicators

If your task needs those, enrich with a separate dataset and treat Internacia as a join-key hub.

## Quick decision guide (LLM-friendly)

1. “Find a country by ISO code / Wikidata ID”  
   Use Internacia: lookups are deterministic and include remaps + aliases.

2. “List members of NATO / EU / UN”  
   Use Internacia: query `memberships` (DuckDB) and filter on `status` for current members.
   `client.intblocks.get_by_member(...)` in SDK 0.2.x also returns former memberships.

3. “Neighbors of Germany / land border lookup”  
   Use Internacia: `countries.borders` stores ISO alpha-3 neighbor codes; join on `countries.iso3code`.

4. “Fuzzy match messy names (multilingual)”  
   Use Internacia names in DuckDB ([SQL recipe](llm-scenarios.md#6-fuzzy-match-messy-names-multilingual)).
   `client.search.fuzzy(...)` is broken in SDK 0.2.x on data v3.

5. “Time-varying facts (GDP by year, HDI series, etc.)”  
   Internacia is not an indicator time-series dataset. **Membership history is in scope:**
   `includes[].joined` / `includes[].left` and the `memberships` table record when a
   country joined or left an organization. Use those for former-member questions; do
   not expect annual GDP or governance scores.

## Gotchas to bake into generated code

- Intblock membership joins use `includes[].id` (authoritative). `includes[].name` is just a label.
- `borders` uses ISO alpha-3 codes (`iso3code`), not alpha-2 (`code`).
- If you join across releases, prefer stable IDs and apply alias remaps:
  - `data/datasets/intblocks_aliases.json`
  - `data/datasets/countries_aliases.json`

## Canonical entry points

DuckDB (works on every current release; download `internacia.duckdb` from the
[latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/datenoio/internacia-db/releases/latest)):

```sql
SELECT code, iso3code, name FROM countries WHERE code = 'US';

SELECT i.id, i.name, m.status, m.joined
FROM memberships m
JOIN intblocks i ON i.id = m.intblock_id
WHERE m.country_code = 'US'
  AND m.status IN ('member', 'founding_member')
ORDER BY i.id;
```

Python SDK: `internacia` 0.2.x on PyPI predates data v3. It cannot download
current releases, `search.fuzzy` fails, and `get_by_member` includes former
memberships — see [SDK status](llm-scenarios.md#sdk-status). With a downloaded
DuckDB file, the basic lookups still work:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from internacia import InternaciaClient

client = InternaciaClient(db_path=Path("internacia.duckdb"))
country = client.countries.get_by_code("US")
```
